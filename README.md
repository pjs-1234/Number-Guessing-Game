# Number-Guessing-Game
Made by Prajjwal Shrivastava


It's a simple game in which you have to guess the number which is randomly generated by the computer. In the end when you make the right guess it shows you how many attempts are taken by you to guess the right number and also it gives the time in seconds you took to complete the game.

First I used Random class to generate a rondom number from 0 to 100 which will be the number which the user has to guess. Then I used Scanner class to take a number as an input by the user. Then I used a while loop to make sure that program repeats itself until user guess the right number. Three reponses could be generated in this while loop, first if user enters the number which is greater than the number randomly generated by the computer, then in this case response is given like, Enter a smaller number, second if user enters smaller number than the randomly generated number, then the response is, Enter a greater number, and third if user guesses the right number then response is, You Won.
